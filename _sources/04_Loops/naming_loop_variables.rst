Naming loop variables
:::::::::::::::::::::
.. sourcecode:: python

    grocery_list = ["bananas", "bread", "flour", "orange juice", "milk"]

    for ___ in grocery_list:
        print(___)

.. mchoice:: test_question3_5_0
    :answer_a: 0) i
    :answer_b: 1) n
    :answer_c: 2) food
    :answer_d: 3) groceries
    :answer_e: 4) things
    :correct: a, b, c
    :feedback_a: Yes, this i commonly used in for loops
    :feedback_b: Yes, this could work as a variable name
    :feedback_c: Yes, this one would be the most descriptive - but others are correct as well
    :feedback_d: The items in the list are groceries, but the iterator is a singular entity so should not be plural
    :feedback_e: The iterator is a singular entity that iterates through each item in the list, representing one at a time.

    In the following code, choose all variable names that would be appropriate for the iterator.
