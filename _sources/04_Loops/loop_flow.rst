Loop flow
:::::::::

As a program executes, the interpreter always keeps track of which statement is
about to be executed. We call this the **control flow**, or the **flow of
execution** of the program. When humans execute programs, they often use their
finger to point to each statement in turn. So you could think of control flow
as "Python's moving finger".

Control flow until now has been strictly top to bottom, one statement at a
time. We call this type of control **sequential**. Sequential flow of control is always assumed to be the default behavior for a computer program. The ``for`` statement changes this.

Flow of control is often easy to visualize and understand if we draw a flowchart.
This flowchart shows the exact steps and logic of how the ``for`` statement executes.

A codelens demonstration is a good way to help you visualize exactly how the flow of control
works with the for loop. Try stepping forward and backward through the program by pressing
the buttons. You can see the value of ``name`` change as the loop iterates through the list of friends.

.. codelens:: vtest

  for name in ["Joe", "Amy", "Brad", "Angelina", "Zuki", "Thandi", "Paris"]:
      print("Hi " + name + ",  please come to my party on Saturday!")
